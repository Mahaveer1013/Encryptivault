## Security Features

### Deletion Password
When deleting passwords, users must provide a deletion password that matches the `DELETION_PASSWORD` environment variable. This adds an extra layer of protection against accidental or unauthorized deletions.

### Client-Side Encryption
All passwords are encrypted on the client side before being stored in the database, ensuring that even if the database is compromised, the passwords remain secure.
